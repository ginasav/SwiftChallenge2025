# ABFeels - Alphabet through emotions

ABFeels is an innovative iPad application that transforms alphabet learning into an emotional journey. By connecting abstract letters to concrete emotions, this app creates an inclusive learning environment that resonates particularly well with children who have linguistic challenges. Each letter becomes the protagonist of its own story, brought to life through hand-crafted illustrations and interactive scenes that respond to intuitive iPad gestures.

### A personal note from the Developer
The journey that led to ABFeels is a story of bridging two worlds that often seem far apart. As a linguistics graduate who found herself drawn to the world of software development, I've always felt caught between my love for human languages and my fascination with programming languages.

During my linguistics studies, I would spend my evenings watching developers bring their ideas to life, secretly wishing I had the courage to pursue that path. The fear of diving into computer science kept me in my comfort zone - until this year. Taking what I call "the dirt road," I enrolled in the Apple Developer Academy in Napoli, and it has been nothing short of transformative.

ABFeels represents the perfect convergence of my academic background and my newfound passion for development. This project began as a theoretical concept during my linguistics studies, designed to help children with language challenges. Now, through coding, it has evolved into an interactive experience that brings together everything I love: language, emotions, and the magic of technology.

To me, coding is like wielding a magic wand - with just the right combination of characters and symbols, we can create experiences that touch people's lives. Every time I see my code bring these emotional characters to life, I experience that same "a-ha" moment that first drew me to development.

This project has helped me realize that my background in linguistics isn't a detour but a unique perspective that enriches my approach to development. Whether this submission succeeds or not, creating ABFeels has been a joyful affirmation that sometimes the most meaningful innovations come from embracing our diverse interests and experiences.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project. I hope it brings as much joy to its users as it brought me during its creation.
